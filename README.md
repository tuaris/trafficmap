## Building & Installing

This is designed to work on FreeBSD, but due to it being so simple may work on other operating systems.  

Build it:

```
make
```

Install it:

```
make install
```

## Package

Of course you may just want to instead use the package

```
cd port/sysutils/traffimap
make package
```
